Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

# Business Recommendations

- Increase bike inventory during summer and fall as demand peaks during these seasons compared to others.
- Working days versus non-working days do not significantly impact bike rentals based on a significance level of 0.05.
- Consider reducing bike availability on days with extremely low humidity, as demand tends to be lower during such conditions.
- Decrease bike availability during very cold days, particularly when the temperature drops below 10 degrees Celsius.
- Similarly, during thunderstorms or when wind speeds exceed 35 km/h, it is advisable to reduce the number of bikes available for rental due to
decreased demand during such weather conditions.
